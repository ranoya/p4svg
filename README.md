# PROCESSING-LIKE API FOR SVG

---

** Project discontinued due redundant effort.**

Please refer to [p5.SVG](https://github.com/zenozeng/p5.js-svg) for building SVG via Processing / P5 instructions.

This project is a laborious, senseless, and probably meaningless, idea of ​​creating a schema, like Processing / P5.js, for building SVGs

It is being designed so that people with some familiarity in Processing / P5.js can use what they are used to in creating SVG graphics, since the outputs of Processing.js and P5.js build graphics on canvas elements (bitmap), and not as vectors (SVG).

What is the use of this? I have no idea. But it may be useful.

Contributions in mirroring the Processing API to SVG / XML tags will be highly appreciated. They are pure manual labor.

Working example at my [https://www.ranoya.com/p4svg](https://www.ranoya.com/p4svg)
(inspect the code in your browser to see the svg tags created and the javascript code that created them)
